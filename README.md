# Store Sales Marketing Analysis  

## Overview  
Analysis of sales transactions (2014–2016) to identify profitable customer segments, measure the effectiveness of discount campaigns, uncover seasonal trends, and evaluate shipping mode preferences.  

**Tools Used:** Excel, Power BI  

---

## Problem Statement
A retail company wanted to answer key marketing questions:
- Which customer segments are most profitable and should be targeted more aggressively?
- What products or sub-categories respond best to discount campaigns?
- Are there seasonal sales patterns by region or category that can guide promotions?
- Do specific cities or customer groups respond differently to shipping modes?

---

## Workflow
1. **Data Cleaning**
   - Removed duplicates in Excel
   - Created unique IDs by combining row information for customers and products to fix the data entry errors (e.g., same product ID for different products, same order ID for different customers).
   - Normalized the table to nearly the 2nd normal form by splitting it into "Customers" and "Products" dimensions, and "SalesTransactions" facts table  
3. **Visualization in Power BI**  
   - Built interactive dashboards for segment profitability, discount effectiveness, seasonal trends, and preferred ship mode.
   - Used DAX to create measures such as sales lift, price change from the previous to the last quarter, average units sold in a day with/without discount.
